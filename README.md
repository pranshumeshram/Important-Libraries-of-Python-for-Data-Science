Important Libraries of Python for Data Science

Welcome to Important Libraries of Python for Data Science! This repository provides an introduction to key Python libraries for data science, with modules covering essential tools for data manipulation, numerical computation, and data visualization.


Module 1: Pandas
Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. This module covers essential functions for data cleaning, transformation, and exploration, enabling you to work with structured data efficiently.

Module 2: Numpy
Numpy is the core library for numerical computations in Python. This module introduces you to its array operations, mathematical functions, and tools for handling large datasets and performing complex calculations.

Module 3: Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a foundational library for data visualization in Python. In this module, youâ€™ll learn to create a variety of static plots and charts to better understand and communicate data insights.

Module 4: Seaborn
Seaborn is a data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib. This module demonstrates how to create more advanced and aesthetically pleasing visualizations, with a focus on statistical graphics.
